The Terminals are the current theory on how reality functions in Exelon. There are four known Terminals, with the rest being a mystery. Each terminal is a seemingly infinite reality of flat ground.
 
The first terminal is known as [[Paraiso\|Paraiso]]. A world of lush plains and vast oceans, people that have traveled to this place never return.

The second is known as [[Erthe\|Erthe]]. A stable reality with cities and people. This is an infinite plane of different biomes and is the most varied of the terminals.

The third is [[Oxidia\|Oxidia]]. A desert world with old megastructures and cities built on the remains of ancient civilizations.

The fourth is only known as [[Idalum\|Idalum]]. Only danger lies within this reality.
