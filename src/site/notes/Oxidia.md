# Oxidia
Oxidia is a desert world with nothing but bits of rusted metal and sand. The air smells of iron and factories in cities churn smoke and grime everywhere. Outside the cities are lawless and small villages struggle to survive. In this reality, the cities are run by three individuals known as the Iron Monarchs.
