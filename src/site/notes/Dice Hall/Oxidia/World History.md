Not much is known about the world of [[Dice Hall/Oxidia/Oxidia\|Oxidia]], all that is present is an infinite desert. However, ancient machines dating back thousands of years have helped Oxidia's cities flourish. In the present day, the world is connected with railways going through the jagged peaks and dunes of Oxidia, this is how trade and transport is handled. 

While the cities are vast there exists settlements of people known as the Oldblood, their actual people's name is the Ihasi. They are a nomadic people that thrive on the desert using their blessing of druidic magic. The actual druids themselves are extremely rare among an already scarce culture. However according to some, a druid can pass down their power through a ritual before their death. The Ihasi are believed to be the descendants of the ancient people that onced walked the land.
